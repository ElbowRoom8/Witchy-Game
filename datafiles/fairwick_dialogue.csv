,,Floofy,Mrow!
,,Player,"That's that, Floofy. we'll go on a cool outing together in no time, but first..."
,,Player,I've got to figure out where my classes are!
,Ignore Great Hall,Player,Or maybe I can spend a little while exploring the school's exterior! It's not like we have to go in right away after all...
,,Floofy,Mrrow?
,,Player,"I'm just not quite ready yet Floofy, It's a big step. Give me a minute out here to calm down, then we'll go in."

,,Player,I wonder what Mom and Dad would think of this place...
,,Player,"It may not be the most prestigious school, but it's my school."
,,Player,I'll work hard to be the best student I can!
,,Prof. Harthemony,"Attention students! Convocation is beginning shortly. Once you have found your classes, please come outside to the courtyard to meet with your new professors. If you need a map of the school, please take one from the bulletin board to my right. That will be all."
,,Player,Woah! That must have been a professor! I wonder if I'll be in his class.
,,Player,I guess I should start taking a look around. That bulletin board seems like a good place to start.
,Need Map,Player,(I don't know where I'm going! I should grab a map from the bulletin board.)
,Grab Map,Player,"Oooh. Here we go, maps!"
,, ,You Acquired the \mFairwick Map\w. You feel slightly less lost.
,,Player,"Now I can explore the school. It looks like I have classes in the \bEast Wing\w and the \bPotions Room\w. I should probably check out the \bCafeteria\w, too."
,Enter Great Hall,Player,"(Right now it says I'm in the \bGreat Hall\w, a place where students gather and events happen. That does sound pretty great!)"
,Enter East Wing,Player,"(This is the \bEast Wing\w, where I have potions class. It's taught by someone named professor Harthemony.)"
,Enter Potions Room,Player,(This is the \bPotions Room\w where both students and professors brew potions)
,Enter Cafeteria,Player,(This is the \bCafeteria\w. I can't wait to try the food!)
,,Floofy,Meeeeeoooow
,,Player,"Yes, Floofy, you can try the cafeteria food too."
,Attempt Courtyard,Player,"(This way leads to the \bCourtyard\w. I can't go yet, they're still getting ready for convocation.)"
,Finish Tour,Player,(It's almost time for convocation. I should go to the \bCourtyard\w if I want to make it in time.)

,,Amber,"Marcus, I already told you no."
,,Player,"Hey you two, what's going on?"
,,Marcus,"Hi! I'm trying to convince Amber to play slime tag with me, but school made her all serious and boring."
,,Amber,"I just want to start the year off on the right foot. Studying is very important if you want good grades, Marcus."
,,Marcus,Why not play slime tag now and study later?
,,Amber,"That's called procrastination, Marcus, and it's a bad habit."

Morgan,Meet Morgan,Lux,Where's this coming from? Was he this bad last year too or–
,,Player,Hi! I'm \p.
,,Lux,"uh, cool? Good for you. Anyway Hero, I really don't think–"
,,Player,"Oh, I wasn't trying to intrude. I'm a first year, and I just came to campus. Do you have any advice for fitting in at Fairwick?"
,,Lux,"Uh, no? Can you please leave?"
,,Morgan,"Lux, don't be rude. Hi (studentName), I'm Hero. At your service. We're fourth-years. "
,,Floofy,M-mroar?
,,Player,"(What, these two are a little intimidating!)"
,,Player,H-hi? What's Fairwick like?
,,Lux,Why did you come here? This school blows.
,,Morgan,"Nah, a couple people just blow. I'll get over it."
,,Lux,"If you want some real advice, take Flitpaw's class. They don't take attendance so it's easy credit. Classes are a waste of time."
,,Player,Shouldn't I go to classes so I can learn potion-making?
,,Lux,"Why? Classes won't actually improve your life. If you want to learn something useful, you're better off exploring the forest. That's what we do."
,,Morgan,HERO: You can come out with us! We're friends with the school chef. If we find Haverin seeds in the forest he'll make them into Haverin for us.
,,Lux,Hero! I thought that was our thing...
,,Player,Haverin?
,,Morgan,"It's an exotic drink. The school imported Haverin seeds into the forest generations ago, though. Back when the school was still prestigious and influential."
,,Lux,"Wait, really? Where'd you even learn that?"
,,Morgan,President Gyre's book
,,Lux,Oh.
,,Lux,My.
,,Lux,GOD.
,,Lux,"You actually read that dusty old thing? I had no idea you were such a nerd, Hero."
,,Morgan,"I'm a nerd, huh? Truffle told me he was teaching you how to process Haverin seeds. Now that is some nerd activity right there."
,,Lux,"That's because I'm addicted, not because I'm interested!"
,,Morgan,"Anyway, come see us tonight in the Great Hall after convocation if you want to have Haverin. We'll bring extra potions and show you how to handle yourself out there"
,,Lux,"Hero, why are we babysitting the first year? Let's just go together like last year."
,,Morgan,"Come on, Lux! It'll be fun to change things up!"
,,Lux,...
,,Lux,"uuuugh, okay."
,,Morgan,Yeah! We'll see you tonight if you feel like joining us.
,,Lux,"Later, kid."
Big Boy,Meet Big Boy,Desmond,"Cats are friends, not food!"
,,Floofy,Nyaw?
,,Big Boy,"Ooooooh, here comes one now."
,,Player,"Hi everybody, what are you all talking about?"
,,Big Boy,We were asking Desmond if he eats cats.
,,Player,Why would he eat cats?
,,Big Boy,‘Cause he's a vampire bat.
,,Desmond,"Actually Big Boy, I'm a pedioid vampire bat. I don't mean anyone any harm"
,,Big Boy,So you aren't going to try and suck out my blood?
,,Desmond,Of course not!
,,Big Boy,"Darn, that would have been rad."
,,Player,My name's \p. I'm a first year. What about you all?
,,Big Boy,I'm a first year too. I like plants.
,,Big Boy,and cats.
,,Big Boy,Desmond is pretty cool too.
,,Big Boy,He'd be cooler if he sucked peoples' blood out.
,,Desmond,"I'm Desmond, I'm a first year like Big Boy. It's nice to meet you."
,,Jeremy,"I'm Jeremy, a third year."
,,Jeremy,I'm trying to win a seat on Student Council this year. Vote for me!
