Item system:

when in storage:
leftclick and hold picks up 1, drag it over to brewer
	shift = 5 ctrl = 10
rightclick picks up 1 at a time, leftclick to drop or place in brewer
	shift = 5, ctrl = 10

when in brewer
leftclick and hold picks up all, place it back or drop it to storage
rightclick picks up 1 at a time, leftclick to drop or place back in brewer
	shift = 5, ctrl = 10
	
item vs modifier is all same, just two separate systems (no mixing)
	modifiers stored at end of item array -> store value somehow?


open potion index (potion storage) and click a potion
	autofills ingredients to make 1 potion, click again to make 2, 3, etc.
		shift = 5, ctrl = 10
click a different potion
	removes all ingredient already in brewer, replaces with new ingredients


press brew to create potions
	checks 3 main ingredients for potion type
	checks modifier to create potion with correct attribute
		if no modifier, do not accept
	consume ingredients, add new potion to array
		consume ingredients if failed recipe???
	minigame? potion delay?
	
	
potion attributes -> stored in a int?
	make a list of possibilities and hard code them?
		ugly but maybe easiest way...
		also what i've already started doing i think
		
	store in string? -> lol no
	give each potion a set of attributes to begin with, and set those at creation?
